# Milestone 4 – Retrieval & LLM Integration

## Learning Objectives
- Implement retrieval of relevant documents.
- Integrate retrieval results with the local LLM to generate responses.
- Expose functionality via FastAPI.

## Activities
- Add a retrieval pipeline that fetches documents based on a query.
- Pass retrieved documents to LLM for response generation.
- Extend FastAPI with:
  - `POST /ask` → accept a query, retrieve documents, and generate an LLM response.

## Deliverables
- [ ] A FastAPI project with working endpoints for document retrieval and LLM integration.
- [ ] Example cURL or Postman requests demonstrating usage.
