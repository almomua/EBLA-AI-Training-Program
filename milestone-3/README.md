# Milestone 3 – Data Preparation & Indexing

## Learning Objectives
- Preprocess text data, create embeddings, and index documents.
- Expose these operations via FastAPI endpoints.

## Activities
- Prepare dataset (text files, articles, or documents).
- Generate embeddings using a vector store (FAISS, ChromaDB, Weaviate, etc.).
- Build a FastAPI service with endpoints:
  - `POST /index` → preprocess and index documents.
  - `POST /search` → accept a query, return relevant documents.

## Deliverables
- [ ] A FastAPI project exposing endpoints to index and manage documents.
- [ ] Documentation explaining how to call the endpoints and what they return.
