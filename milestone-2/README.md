# Milestone 2 – RAG & Core Technologies

## Learning Objectives
- Understand Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture.
- Familiarize with a local LLM (e.g., DeepSeek, GPT-OSS, LLaMA) and an indexing library (LlamaIndex or LangChain).

## Activities
- Study RAG architecture (retriever, generator, integration).
- Install and configure a local LLM.
- Write initial scripts to interact with the chosen LLM and index a few documents.

## Deliverables
- [ ] A discussion summary of RAG concepts.
- [ ] A Python script demonstrating interaction with your chosen local LLM + a simple index build.
